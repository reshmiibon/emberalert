      'The purpose of EmberAlert is to help revolutionize wildfire management by predicting wildfire progressions and ' +
      'providing timely alerts to those in at-risk areas. This project arose from Canada and Americaâ€™s escalating frequency and ' +
      'intensity of wildfires where relying on locals to report wildfires results in delayed awareness, missed evacuation opportunities, and lost lives. \n' +
      '\n\n' +
      'By integrating geospatial data, current weather metrics, and satellite-derived imagery, the goal is to develop a ' +
      'comprehensive model that can predict wildfire progressions. Through a web application, the aim is to offer residents ' +
      'and first responders a clear visualization forecast of anticipated wildfire spreads, complimented by a notification ' +
      'system for prompt alerts. With this project, the hope is to work towards a future where communities are better ' +
      'informed, prepared, and protected against the unpredictable nature of wildfires'
