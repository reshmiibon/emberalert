## Description
The purpose of this system is to help revolutionize wildfire management by predicting wildfire progressions and
providing timely alerts to those in at-risk areas. This project arose from Canada and Americaâ€™s escalating frequency
and intensity of wildfires where relying on locals to report wildfires results in delayed awareness, missed evacuation
opportunities, and lost lives.

By integrating geospatial data, current weather metrics, and satellite-derived imagery, the goal is to develop a
comprehensive model that can predict wildfire progressions. Through a web application, the aim is to offer residents
and first responders a clear visualization forecast of anticipated wildfire spreads, complimented by a notification
system for prompt alerts. With this project, the hope is to work towards a future where communities are better
informed, prepared, and protected against the unpredictable nature of wildfires

## Prerequisites:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) 
- [gcloud cli](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- [node](https://nodejs.org/en)
- A key for:
    - Twillio
    - Google Maps Platform
    - FIRMS
    - OpenWeather Map API
- A Google Cloud Project


## Installation / Running instructions
- Pull the repo
- Create a file in ./src/backend/ called `constants.py`, in this file you will need to provide the following keys:
```
# COMMENT / UNCOMMENT DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU'RE WORKING / TESTING FROM. Docker container = database, local = localhost
#DATABASE_HOST_NAME = 'localhost'
DATABASE_HOST_NAME = 'database'


FIRMS_API_KEY = 'FIRMS_API_KEY'

OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY = 'OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY'

EE_PROJECT_NAME = 'EE_PROJECT_NAME'

TWILLIO_ACCOUNT_SID = 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID'
TWILLIO_ACCOUNT_AUTH_TOKEN = 'YOUR ACCOUNT AUTH TOKEN'
```
- Create a file in ./src/frontend called `.env` with the following keys:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = 'YOUR_KEY'
```
- Setup your gcloud authentication file by running ``gcloud auth application-default login``
- Navigate to ``src/`` and run ``docker compose up -d``
- Navigate to ``src/frontend`` and run ``npm install``. Then run ``npm run dev``.
